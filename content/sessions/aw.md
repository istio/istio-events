"Organizations that are running a handful (or more) of microservices deploy Istio to provide a substrate of secure connectivity, uniform visibility, and granular control over service requests. Operating at Layer 5, Istio fills unmet service-level needs.

This workshop introduces service mesh concepts and each aspect of Istio. Gain hands-on experience with this popular tool as you learn how to deploy and configure Istio alongside microservices running in Kubernetes.

What you'll learn:

- Managing telemetry, monitoring, and reporting
- Traffic management scenarios
- Approaches to canary deployments and securing communication

Youâ€™ll be able to:

- Configure and operate Istio in context of an example workloads and their common use cases
- Manage traffic through load balancing and resilient communications
- Enforce policies and rate limiting
- Be confident with ongoing management of Istio
- Understand WebAssembly filters for Envoy and deploy a custom filter"
