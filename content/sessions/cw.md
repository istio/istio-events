This workshop is based on Istio and Gloo Mesh (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo-mesh). 

It's a hands-on workshop where each participant has a dedicated VM and we will go through diferent labs.

* Deploying 3 Kubernetes clusters using Kind.
* Learning how to set up a management plane with Gloo Mesh.
* Federating the identity of the Istio clusters 
* Configuring cross cluster communications, 
* Experimenting with WASM

Before each lab, we will go through the key concepts.

The labs are publicly available:
