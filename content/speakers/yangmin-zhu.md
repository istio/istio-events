I'm Istio security maintainer and software engineer from Google. I have been working on Istio since 2018 and currently mainly work on the Istio security policy. 
 
I co-designed the Istio Authorization and implemented the feature in both Envoy and Istio. I have made many improvements to the mTLS and JWT policy as well and also member of the Istio product security work group.
