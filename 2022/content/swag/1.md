description: "Istio in Action teaches you how to implement an Istio-based service mesh that can handle complex routing scenarios, traffic encryption, authorization, and other common network-related tasks. You’ll start by defining a basic service mesh and exploring the data plane with Istio’s service proxy, Envoy. Then, you’ll dive into core topics like traffic routing and visualization and service-to-service authentication, as you expand your service mesh to workloads on multiple clusters and legacy VMs."
