Red Hat is rethinking how the automobile industry updates software in cars; we are adding wheels to the world's leading enterprise Linux platform. 


The Red Hat Engineering team is looking for a Software Engineering Manager to join us. In this role, you'll manage a globally-distributed team of engineers and architects, working closely with product managers, program managers, agile practitioners, and community members to create Red Hat's first ever offering of Linux in cars. This is a new venture with a lot to discover. 

You will be a member of an engineering team that embraces psychological safety, enabling every team member to contribute to team success. The team will focus on the engineering activities underpinning functional safety certification. Your knowledge and experience conducting (automotive) functional safety certification will be extremely valuable. The majority of the team is based in Central Europe and the work location for this position is flexible; Red Hat has offices throughout Europe, the United States, and Canada, and home-based, remote candidates in countries where Red Hat is registered to do business will also be considered.
