In this session, we will start with an overview of service mesh security best practices, discussing the various aspects of security that must be considered when securing services with a mesh. Since the components of the mesh are also part of the environment, we will discuss methods to ensure the mesh itself is secure. Ultimately, we will zoom in on one aspect, considering the entire lifecycle of authoring, implementing, monitoring, and validating security policies at scale.
