Splunk is heavily using Istio for the last 3 years, using it as our baseline for network ingress, policy and authentication.

This session will explore how we manage, install and operationalize istio at scale on more than 40 clusters across multiple regions and providers. We will describe in detail our journey, including the trade-offs that were taken into account before jumping into Istio as well as the lessons learned over time. We will also go into details on how our internal users are using Istio and how we support them.
