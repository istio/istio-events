This workshop will demonstrate how to run distributed services on multiple Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Anthos Service Mesh (ASM). ASM is Googleâ€™s fully managed Istio-compliant service mesh, which ultimately unburdens your operations and development teams. This hands-on workshop will show how Google removes the overhead of managing your control plane, while providing visibility on security, observability, and monitoring for your services.

In this workshop, you will learn how to go beyond just deploying an application with ASM, and move on to managing operations:
 * Observe and monitor your services
 * Consistently apply policies to secure your environment
 * Reduce administrative complexity for you and your team

This guide is intended for platform administrators and service operators with basic knowledge of Kubernetes. Some knowledge of service mesh is helpful, but not necessary.
