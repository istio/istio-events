As a Field Engineer at Solo.io, the speaker helps organizations of all sizes install and upgrade Istio in production every day. What we already know is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to perform upgrades. Enterprise platform owners and service owners maintain distinctive environments and Istio deployment models depending on their tenancy, security, and cost requirements. The varying risk tolerance for a potential downtime during an upgrade is another factor to consider. Developing a custom plan is often critical to address an organization's unique architecture and constraints.
 
In this session, the speaker will outline the various upgrade strategies, their advantages and disadvantages, the gotchas that you need to watch out for, and most importantly - some best practices you can apply from day 1 to ensure successful upgrades in the future.
