Following the Istio Security Best Practices page is a daunting task for newcomers to Istio. Even experienced operators have difficulty discerning where to begin. In this talk I will present an easy way for beginners to adopt Istio and settings/configuration based on my years of experience setting up and deploying Istio. Attendees will gain peace of mind knowing they can implement Istio securely according to established best practices.
