This talk will discuss how IBM leverages Istio as the bedrock of its Cloud for Financial Services. Providing a performant, secure, and compliant control plane for its core systems. It will discuss the challenges and pitfalls encountered during adoption; the evolution of the deployment process and its impact on production environments; and the configurations needed to maintain scale and performance for robust systems. The goal of this talk is to provide insight into the IBM Cloud Istio journey and generate a discussion on what is coming next.
