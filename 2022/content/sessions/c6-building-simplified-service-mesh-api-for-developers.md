One of the key goals of service mesh is to decouple developers and operators so that developers can continue to focus on writing code for their services, while operators adds security, resilience, and policies to these services they manage. In the Istio community over the past few years, we have observed that customers such as AirBnb, Salesforce, eBay etc building out abstractions over Istio for their developers. This talk will introduce these abstractions, compare them, along with the thought process behind the service mesh API for developers built at Solo and AirBnb.
