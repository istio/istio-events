Did you ever want to better understand how Istio enables some of its features such as mTLS, route manipulation or multi-cluster communication? With the help of istioctl you can look at how Istio configures Envoy and use that information to build your own local istio-proxy. Learning how Istio configures Envoy is not only good for debugging, but also enables you do more complex routing like secure multi-cluster communication. In this session, Nick will explain how you can configure a local istio-proxy to connect securely to a cloud based service mesh all the while explaining concepts like PKI, mTLS, east/west routing, and request/response transformations.
