Are you interested in contributing to Istio and wondering how to get started or would you like to learn more about our community? 
 
Istio is an open source project with a very diverse and active community of users, vendors and contributors. Since its launch in 2017, Istio has seen exponential growth and adoption, with more companies starting to use Istio in production. One of the key contributing factors to this growth is the great community of contributors who have been actively contributing to the project.   
 
There are many ways in which you can contribute to Istio. In this talk, we will go over how the Istio community is structured and the various roles and workgroups within the community. We will also go over how you can get started with contributing and grow within the community.
