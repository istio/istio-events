During this virtual 1 hour experience, you and your team are sent on an important mission to Mars! With a guided host, race the clock to make your way through the different rooms of the spaceship to save the day. The winning team will get a surprise gift! Note: As we have limited spots, we will share via email the registration form with the event participants.
