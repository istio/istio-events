Salesforce is onboarding several open source stacks onto Service Mesh. As part of that, we have been solving a lot of advanced usecases with the features supported by Istio. This presentation walks you through how we have used Istio features to onboard these open source stacks onto Mesh. This presentation specifically covers
 
 * Hbase running in a Multicluster setup with Istio DNS
 * Cassandra running in a Multicluster setup with Istio DNS
 * Onboarding Trino
 * RabbitMQ with K8s Peer discovery
 * AWS services like Elastic Cache (with Auth support) and Postgres (with startTLS support)
