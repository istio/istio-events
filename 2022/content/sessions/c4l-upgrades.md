In this listening session we are looking for your feedback on Istio upgrades. Some of the items on which we would like to know your opinion are:
 * Are upgrades getting easier? How easy is easy enough? 
 * Are helm and revision based upgrades catching on? What is still painful? 
 * How often do you upgrade? How often would you like to? 
 * Are patches easier than minor upgrades?

This session will be led by Sam Naser & Jacob Delgado. We will begin each session with a 5 minute overview of the topic and the remainder of the time will be an “open mic”.
