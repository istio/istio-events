As Istio adoption becomes mainstream within your organization, new challenges surrounding multi-tenancy and security across multi-cluster will naturally start to grow:

 - Which group owns what process/workflow? 
 - Which cluster(s) does each policy affect?  
 - How to provide control to some groups, while blocking access to others w.r.t. the mesh?
 - How does an administrator set this up in a secure fashion? 
 - How can we stay informed about potential policy violations?
 - How can this be fully automated?
 
In this discussion, Will and Alex will discuss these topics in detail and review strategies and experiences tackling these challenges with some of the largest deployments of service mesh in the world.
