With the acceleration of Kubernetes adoption to shift a ton of business applications, IT Ops/SREs get higher dissatisfaction and lower retention due to unplanned downtime of the cluster as well as the application. Developers/Architects have concerns about increased unplanned downtime due to hard-to-diagnose bugs as well as "Big bang" rolling out of updates to applications can be risky due to unforeseen issues.
 
This hands-on lab will showcase how the Istio Service Mesh allows developers and IT staff to gain a deep understanding of their Kubernetes native applications based on Quarkus and Spring Boot, and how to take an existing application and form a service mesh around its services to obtain such understanding. Developers will also learn how to use the service mesh to provide powerful visualization and control over their distributed Kubernetes native applications.
