Building distributed applications is hard! Building globally scalable distributed applications is harder! Maintaining and growing these services as your business grows is even harder!

This session takes an opinionated approach on how to create globally scalable platforms on multi-cluster, multi-regional and multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster architectures using Istio. 
 
The session covers (design opinions and reasonings for) the following concepts.
 
 1. Designing multi-cluster Kubernetes platforms 
 2. Application multi-tenancy
 3. Global networking, ingress, multi-cluster load balancing, locality considerations
 4. Security - AuthN, AuthZ, NetPol
 5. Ops - Observability, dashboards
 6. Application and cluster life-cycle management
 7. Demo (on GCP)
