Gergo spent a decade in the telecommunications industry where he worked on developing carrier grade cloud infrastructures, including Kubernetes. With that he joined IBM to work on IBM Kubernetes Service networking. Gergo had a bunch of talks on Hungarian meetups about both corporate and open-source projects. Once he contributed one character to the Linux kernel. :-)
