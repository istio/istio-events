Shriram is a Staff Engineer at Intuit. Currently working in the Service Mesh team and also has recently started contributing to the open-source Istio project. He enjoys working with large-scale distributed systems. He loves to read and bike on the weekends but due to lack of time, he has combined both these activities by listening to audible while riding.
