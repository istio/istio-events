Raphael is a Tech Lead in the Platform Network team at Mercari, Inc in Tokyo, Japan. He genuinely enjoys the network in cloud and distributed systems while scratching his head whenever an issue happens there, which is very often as it is always the network.
With his team, he spent the last 1.5 year trying to adopt Istio within their infrastructure, with ups and downs.
