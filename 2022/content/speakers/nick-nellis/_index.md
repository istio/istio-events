Nick started out his career as a software developer and transitioned into a cloud DevOps role where he became an expert in both AWS and Google Cloud building out large scale enterprise environments. Working mostly on smaller teams, there was always a need to automate as much as possible. He quickly adopted service mesh for its capabilities in managing large scale environments, as well as the observability capabilities it provides. Today, Nick helps other companies adopt, implement and utilize service mesh in many different environments.
