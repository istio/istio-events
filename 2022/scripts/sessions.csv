a6,Proxyless gRPC,proxyless-grpc,"gRPC has been a popular choice for building microservices based service mesh architectures especially after the recent introduction of service mesh features such as service discovery, load balancing, mTLS for transport security, and observability which eliminated the need for sidecar proxies - like Envoy - in the service mesh. The introduction of these features in gRPC enabled a ""proxyless service mesh"". Besides supporting Google's Traffic Director proxyless service mesh product, proxyless gRPC also works with Istio because of the use of ""xDS"" - the industry standard and open protocol created by Envoy. 
 
The talk will include the use-case of how you can manage gRPC workloads without having to deploy an Envoy sidecar. It will also include the current efforts to standardize Istio support across all gRPC languages and multiple environments.

b3,The road to microservice for Database as a Service (DBaaS) via Istio,microservice-dbaas,"Database as a Service (DBaaS) saw a significant growth YoY. One reason for the growth of DBaaS is explosive growth of data. The pandemic created strong data growth.
 
However, well designed DBaaS systems tend to adopt a stateless, loosely coupled architecture, with efficient message passing to produce a scalable, stable and reliable service. In addition, serving for multi-tenants to reduce cost and provide highly availability and scalability is a important offering of DBaaS.

Successful multi-tenant platforms require massive scalability, online patching/upgrading, the ability to process high volumes of data ingestion.
 
To make the DBaaS become more cloud native, there is a journey to migrate the legacy monolithic systems into microservice architecture. And as an excellent project of service mesh, Istio become the first choice to help to complete this process. 
 
In this talk, the audience can know the whole process to build a DBaaS in cloud native mode via Istio.","Peng Hui Jiang, Huailong Zhang","17c496f0-472c-462c-80c8-b08bc9ff8c9b, 01a859a5-b55a-4be2-9b1b-5ecca26a150f",324399,Apr-25 19:40,35,2022-04-26T02:40:00.000Z,2022-04-26T03:15:00.000Z,Presentation,"Tools, features & functionality",Chinese,/sessions/microservice-dbaas,28 Mar 2022 3:54 AM,28 Mar 2022 7:46 AM,,

b5,Flexible proxy configuration of service mesh under diverse workloads,flexible-proxy-configuration,"As the scale of the cluster managed by the service mesh grows and the needs of diverse business scenarios, the proxy configuration corresponding to each different workload will also be different. Although global configuration and Pod Annotation configuration can complete diversified settings, when the number of Pods increases, it becomes more difficult for user to manage the proxy configuration.
 
In this topic, we propose a global, namespace-level, and workload-level approach to managing proxy configuration, compatible with Pod Annotation. In Alibaba Cloud Service Mesh ASM, starting from v1.10, you can manage namespace-level proxy configuration in a declarative way, such as setting sidecar proxy life cycle, resource limit, and so on. istio introduced ProxyConfig from v1.13, which is similar to the above solution, and we will integrate the two in the future.","阳 刘, Lan Zhang","0022e65b-4150-43fc-96e3-34d7afd44668, 0481bb4e-aad4-4220-b3d3-884b27b1f0a3",323469,Apr-25 21:00,35,2022-04-26T04:00:00.000Z,2022-04-26T04:35:00.000Z,Presentation,Infrastructure & networking,Chinese,/sessions/flexible-proxy-configuration,28 Mar 2022 3:54 AM,30 Mar 2022 6:20 AM,,

We are excited to share an approach to tackle it by spinning up a developer/feature environment on demand, which only contains a subset of services that have code changes. Traffic to other services and datastores, which are not in the developer environment, is routed to a shared environment. This whole setup is orchestrated by Istio service mesh. With this, we can have multiple developer environments running in-parallel sharing the same shared environment - enabling the developer and/or feature development team to have an isolated environment to test out the code changes and rollout with confidence.  
 
This has been adopted across our organisation, improving the developer productivity & experience along with stability of shared environments while keeping costs in check.","Rajath Ramesh, Edward Samuel Pasaribu","6ad1f82a-da57-4656-8758-1dde0fc3b6ec, 56a823a1-544e-4282-bebc-8a1614b23d25",315599,Apr-27 9:40,35,2022-04-27T16:40:00.000Z,2022-04-27T17:15:00.000Z,Presentation,"Tools, features & functionality",English,/sessions/on-demand-developer-environments,25 Mar 2022 9:35 PM,27 Mar 2022 8:12 AM,,

 蚂蚁集团运行着全球最大的 kubernetes集群之一。kubernetes 社区官方以 5K node 作为 kubernetes 规模化的事实标准，而蚂蚁集团在 2019 年的时候，就已经维护着单集群规模超过 10K node 的 kubernetes 集群，现如今规模更是远超10K，集群数量也持续增长；
 
 蚂蚁集群采用KOK（Kubernetes On Kubernetes）的方式来管理内部的众多集群。
 
 
 面临的问题
 
 集群数量多，单集群规模大，这给日常运维和稳定性保障带来了很大的挑战：
 
 1. apiserver流量均衡的问题，http2的连接复用导致实例间流量差别巨大，
 2. webhook/controller无法做到精细化的灰度发布；
 3. 原生k8s无体系化的精细限流能力，导致apiserver很容易被流量打死； 
 4. apiserver/webhook等组件的发布无损问题；
 5. 缺乏全链路追踪能力；
 
 
 我们的方案
 
 为体系化解决以上问题，我们引入了Istio。
 
 在KOK架构中，增加了ServiceMesh层来管理管控组件（apiserver/webhook/controller）之间的流量；
 
 调整之后，架构就变成了kubernetes on Istio on Kubernetes，简称KOI架构（kubernetes On Istio）；

 
 本次分享的内容
 
  1. 蚂蚁当前情况介绍，包括k8s集群的规模、当前的KOK架构及面临的问题；
  2. 蚂蚁KOI架构详细介绍； 如何利用istio来有效提升k8s管控面的稳定性、优化系统架构、提升流量调度能力及增强链路的安全性； istio落地中碰到的问题：主要包括envoy参数的调优、http2 flood check问题、k8s认证的适配等； 
  3. 通过落地istio拿到的收益；主要包括： kubernetes webhook/apiserver/controller的精细化灰度能力，支持namespace粒度；apiserver/webhook的流量均衡及无损发布能力；kubernetes大版本的无损升级能力；基于真实流量镜像实现了etcd新版本的测试仿真； 关键链路（ingress/apiserver/webhook/etcd）的全链路追踪能力；

With proliferation of microservices architecture and increased communication between them it's natural for these services to be on Service Mesh. By moving the API Gateway to Service Mesh, microservices that have external clients can continue to take traffic from API Gateway while converging their ingress onto a single path over Istio Service Mesh. At Intuit, this approach resulted in a complete zero trust model architecture and greatly simplified the networking and traffic management for the applications. It also helped accelerate their journey to Service Mesh.

 - Can my service meshes span across on-prem and cloud?
 - How can I allow multiple teams to share the same service meshes?
 - How can I set up global observability?

f5a,"Perfectly (Load) Balanced, as all requests should be",perfectly-load-balanced,"Have you read about Load Balancing while onboarding to Istio, but never tried it out? Or maybe you just want to learn more about how Istio uses its Envoy sidecar proxies to support Load Balancing. This talk will discuss why we need Load Balancing, its benefits, and how you can stress test your service mesh so you don’t risk your own traffic. We’ll demo a simple multi-cluster setup of an online store sample app – Online Boutique – to showcase some Load Balancing capabilities. You will walk away with an understanding of Istio’s weighted least request load balancer.","Christine Kim, Nim Jayawardena","99ea404b-b6a0-4764-8602-dd2d037bfa56, 26530b70-2611-4c3a-b8b5-6de221e44cea",324787,Apr-28 11:30,10,2022-04-28T18:30:00.000Z,2022-04-28T18:40:00.000Z,Lightning talk,Getting started,English,/sessions/perfectly-load-balanced,25 Mar 2022 9:40 PM,28 Mar 2022 1:06 PM,,
f5b,Egress Woes: Debugging external service traffic in Istio,egress-woes,"You have successfully deployed Istio, there are sidecars injected in all your services and pods can talk to each other. Now it's time to start looking outside your service mesh and getting your pods talking to services outside of your cluster. It's time to introduce ServiceEntries. Defining traffic routing behavior in Istio for external services does not happen automatically. Users need to often create four separate CRD's to define external traffic routing behavior and that introduces four potential avenues for bugs to get introduced. This talk will cover common pitfalls in egress configurations and debugging techniques for when those calls to external databases start failing.",Gregory Hanson,199b9b7b-6c14-4fef-9160-97353326c0dd,325484,Apr-28 11:40,10,2022-04-28T18:40:00.000Z,2022-04-28T18:50:00.000Z,Lightning talk,Getting started,English,/sessions/egress-woes,25 Mar 2022 9:40 PM,28 Mar 2022 12:33 PM,,

f6,Managed service mesh as a distributed cloud service,managed-service-mesh-as-a-distributed-cloud-service,"The external control plane deployment model in Istio enabled some new use cases for mesh management. The ownership and the management of the control plane may belong to a completely different entity, other than the end-user.
 
Leveraging this new model, a cloud vendor can create a cost effective, managed, multi-tenant mesh control plane, safely isolated from the mesh clusters. Behind the scene, the vendor can manage/scale/update the service with or without the user's intervention.
 
In this talk I will describe such a managed solution, focusing on the extra challenges that the basic Istio external control plane setup does not solve. 

Agenda: 
 * the generic problem of running kubernetes operators and webhook services remotely to the managed cluster
 * exposing control plane endpoints
 * the problem domain of metrics collection
 * how to hide/embed/manage and automate the control-plane parts from the user
 * how and why multi-tenant control plane can be safely operated",Gergő Huszty,f6aa8e0d-621a-4621-af59-5d5041623c29,324417,Apr-28 12:10,35,2022-04-28T19:10:00.000Z,2022-04-28T19:45:00.000Z,Presentation,Infrastructure & networking,English,/sessions/managed-service-mesh-as-a-distributed-cloud-service,31 Mar 2022 5:49 AM,31 Mar 2022 2:31 PM,,
f7,A Field Guide for Safe Istio Upgrades,a-field-guide-for-safe-istio-upgrades,"As a Field Engineer at Solo.io, the speaker helps organizations of all sizes install and upgrade Istio in production every day. What we already know is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to perform upgrades. Enterprise platform owners and service owners maintain distinctive environments and Istio deployment models depending on their tenancy, security, and cost requirements. The varying risk tolerance for a potential downtime during an upgrade is another factor to consider. Developing a custom plan is often critical to address an organization's unique architecture and constraints.
 
In this session, the speaker will outline the various upgrade strategies, their advantages and disadvantages, the gotchas that you need to watch out for, and most importantly - some best practices you can apply from day 1 to ensure successful upgrades in the future.",Ram Vennam,9322b021-8898-4b31-bca8-70abb6028965,324119,Apr-28 12:50,35,2022-04-28T19:50:00.000Z,2022-04-28T20:25:00.000Z,Presentation,Infrastructure & networking,English,/sessions/a-field-guide-for-safe-istio-upgrades,25 Mar 2022 9:35 PM,30 Mar 2022 4:20 PM,,

We will also go over how you can get started with contributing and grow within the community.",Mariam John,2a64715c-80c0-48f0-9bb0-e0958de3bd42,324538,Apr-29 8:45,10,2022-04-29T15:45:00.000Z,2022-04-29T15:55:00.000Z,Lightning talk,Getting started,English,/sessions/getting-started-in-the-istio-community,25 Mar 2022 9:40 PM,No,,
g2,Safeguard Istio Service Mesh via Confidential computing,safeguard-confidential-computing,"Security is a key feature for Isito service mesh. Service-to-service communication can be secured automatically without application code change. In the mesh edge side, the ingress and egress gateway can help you do TLS termination or origination as well. Private keys are important parts to fullfill all these functions and currently they are all exposed in clear text. This exposes rich attack surface for your service mesh. In this talk you will learn about confidential computing and how you can leverage it to improve the overall security level for Istio service mesh.","Iris Ding, Srinivasa Addepalli","bc736252-8a79-4d8d-aeef-733b280dd700, 6f8f6467-4a64-4f1c-8832-9c3b0f0b3dfc",324259,Apr-29 9:00,35,2022-04-29T16:00:00.000Z,2022-04-29T16:35:00.000Z,Presentation,Infrastructure & networking,English,/sessions/safeguard-confidential-computing,25 Mar 2022 9:40 PM,No,,

The Cloud Native ecosystem is one of the exemplary communities which could make a great impact on improving the security posture of open source software while allowing organisations to consume open source in a fast, secure & sustainable manner. This talk will highlight a few ongoing initiatives across cloud native projects for standardised generation of Software Bill Of Materials, and how the same procedure was applied to Istio by adopting SPDX standard using K8s bom. We will also discuss how these security standards can help ease the consumption of the opensource code by organisations, and the importance and the necessity of cross collaboration and pollination between projects.","Faseela Kundattil, Adolfo García Veytia","9235a799-bc39-4014-9d4b-7f47c6b1aac5, f24bbabc-3191-4e09-8a2c-8fc6ced95aa6",318631,Apr-29 9:40,35,2022-04-29T16:40:00.000Z,2022-04-29T17:15:00.000Z,Presentation,"Tools, features & functionality",English,/sessions/istio-and-supply-chain-security,25 Mar 2022 9:35 PM,26 Mar 2022 11:58 AM,,
