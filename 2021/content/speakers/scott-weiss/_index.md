I've been working with the founders of solo since our days at EMC working on Mesos and Cloud Foundry. To me, service mesh is by far the most exciting innovation to emerge in this market since Kubernetes itself. I'm passionate about understanding and participating in this burgeoning ecosystem. Outside of work I love to paint, travel, and develop goofy video games.
