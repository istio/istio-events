After starting his career at Cisco, Nicolas joined Atlassian over 6 years ago to build its network and transition it all to Cloud Infrastructure. He's been steadily climbing up the network stack and these days spends most of his time getting the Atlassian PaaS to take as many HTTP and networking concerns away from service developers as possible.
