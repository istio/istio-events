Iâ€™m Albert, a high school senior who is passionate about UX design and has experience in competitive programming and web development. I started contributing to Istio.io last summer, and made a few commits with the help of the community. These included adding the automation indicator to the website, and I also started an Istio.io homepage redesign proposal. I love learning new things related to computers, and Istio was an incredible opportunity to learn and apply my skills.
